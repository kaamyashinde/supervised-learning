    "# 🌟 Operation NeuroNexus\n",
    "\n",
    "Trondheim lies under the iron grip of SkyNet, an AI system that has seized control of the city's entire digital infrastructure. You and your team of elite hackers have been tasked with a crucial mission: infiltrate SkyNet's systems, decode its defenses, and liberate the city from its digital oppressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Mission Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation NeuroNexus consists of four independent, yet interconnected missions. Each mission targets a different aspect of SkyNet's infrastructure and requires you to apply various Supervised Learning techniques covered in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Mission Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each mission has a specific task related to combating SkyNet.\n",
    "2. Following the task description, you'll find a set of formal requirements that your solution must meet.\n",
    "3. The primary measure of your success is the accuracy of your machine learning model.\n",
    "4. After completing each task, you must answer a series of questions to demonstrate your understanding of the techniques used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 A Note on Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In a departure from real-world scenarios, you will have access to the target variables of the test sets for each mission. This has been arranged to facilitate the evaluation of your models. However, remember that in actual machine learning projects, test targets are not available, as predicting these is the ultimate goal of your supervised models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Submission Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each mission, provide your code solution and model results inside this notebook.\n",
    "- Answer the follow-up questions in markdown format within this notebook. A few sentences is enough, no requirements for length of answers.\n",
    "- Ensure your explanations are clear, concise, and demonstrate a deep understanding of the techniques employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck! The resistance is counting on you."
